# qgislinedirectionhistogramplugin
A QGIS plugin to create a histogram (rose diagram) of line directions. Visualize the distribution of line segment 
directions as a rose diagram (weighted using the line segment lengths). Save the rose diagram as CSV, PDF or SVG. 

Created by HÃ¥vard Tveite, who passed away several years ago. Updated for use in modern QGIS versions by KoBold Metals.

Tested with QGIS 3.40.1 on Mac and PC, but 3.36 should work too
